					<p>
						Some websites, such as CNN, load content from external web sites such as Facebook or Twitter.  This can cause your corporate proxy or web filter
						to raise messages saying that the content is blocked.  In many cases these messages are annoying.  This plug-in prevents these websites from
						loading content from the websites you identify thus preventing those annoying messages.  <u>This plug-in does not enable to get around your corporate
						proxy or web filter</u>.
